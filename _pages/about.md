Hi! I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Guha Balakrishnan](https://www.guhabalakrishnan.com/home).
My research interests encompass computer vision, deep learning, and their downstream applications. My primarily focus lies on 3D scene understanding, including generative video editing/inpainting, large-scale 3D reconstruction, and human social behavior analysis in city environments.

Before joining Rice, I completed my B.S and M.S. in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://eceweb.rice.edu/) at [Ewha Womans [sic] University](https://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/index.do). My master's thesis concerned quality-adaptive compression artifact removal by exploiting domain adaptation, advised by [Prof. Jewon Kang](https://sagittak.wixsite.com/icplab/professor). Outside of research and academia, I enjoy camping, hiking, and climbing.


## Updates
* I will be presenting our new paper [DRAGON](https://yujinh22.github.io/publication/dragon) at ICCP 2024 in Switzerland!
* I received the [ICCP 2024 Student Travel Award](https://iccp-conference.org/iccp2024/student-travel-award/)!
